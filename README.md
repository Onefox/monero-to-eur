# Monero to Euro converter with the lowest fees possible
This small python 3 script is for converting xmr (Monero) coins to EUR and withdrawing them to a bank accout.

I build it in order to change Monero for the lowes possible fee back to EUR and transfer them back to my bankaccount.

Normally this script takes about ~90 minutes. 30 minutes for the Monero do confirm on poloniex
and another 60 minutes for the Bitcoin to confirm on kraken (Yes kraken still needs 6 confirmations)
